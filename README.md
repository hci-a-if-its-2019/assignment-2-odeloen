# Sketching and Prototyping
Using the information in the results of Assignment 1 for what is good and bad about the UI for designed tasks, we are going to make **Sketches** and **Prototypes**. These sketches and prototypes will lead to better design in Assignment 3. The prototypes will be then tested through a usability evaluation followed by design revision in Assignment 4.

## Part A: Sketches
Sketch at least **3 (three)** different UIs for the functions you are targeting. These three interfaces should be _dramatically different_ in terms of design directions. For example, they can be with different organizations of what functions on each screen or using a different layout of the icons, widgets, and menus on the screens. If you want, you can also incorporate non-on-screen UIs: physical buttons, gestures through motion sensors, etc.

You need **not** sketch the whole interface. It is not necessary for the sketches to have every function or every function in detail, but there should be enough to show off your general idea. **Be creative!** Draw your idea and label a few of the widgets so we can tell your intent. The goal is to have at least 3 good UIs in *interesting* ways. Sketches should be done on paper with pens and/or pencils (do not use a computer).

### 2. Version Differences
Original  
  
In the original design, user is confused about what to do with the page. Because, the portal design used a plain picture as their hyperlink without any special effects indicating that those pictures can be clicked.  

Solution 1  

In solution number one, the user know that he/she can make choices because they see a dropdown. So, when they click the dropdown page, they know that they can go to different pages.  

Solution 2  

In solution number two. The choices can be seen easily by the user. User now can get the rough idea that the page is a portal page.  Because they now have outer indicator and a "kunjungi" word.  

Solution 3  

In solution number three. The choices do not have the outer indicator, they just have a special effects when the mouse is hovering over them.  

### 3. Selected Sketch

Personally, i prefer solution 2 as the selected sketch. Because the design is simple, easy to be implemented, eye catching, and informative.  

### 4. Design Rationale

The main problem with the original design is the lack of indicator that the user can receive so they can imply that this is a portal page not a main page or an error page.  


## Part B: Assumptions
### 1. Hardware

Physical Input : Mouse and Keyboard  
Screen Size : 14 inch  
Screen Resolution : Mininimal (1366 x 768)  
Screen Color Space : RGB  

### 2. Users

Experience Level : Novice, proficient in using keyboard, mouse, and a browser  
Age : 12+  
Actually, if the user actually acessing this web for learning purposes, i expect the user is interested in computer science.  

## Part C: Prototypes
We will work on this part together during the class on **March 22nd, 2019**, 10:00 AM - 12.30 PM. Therefore, prior to the class please complete all the above parts (A & B) beforehand accordingly.
